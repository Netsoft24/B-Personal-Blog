We live in an era of accumulation. More tabs, more tasks, more notifications. Somewhere along the way, we began equating busyness with meaning, and volume with value. But what if the most productive thing you could do today was to stop?

## The Paradox of Choice

Barry Schwartz wrote about it decades ago, but the thesis has only grown sharper with time: the more options we have, the less capable we are of choosing any of them well. Simplicity isn't a retreat from ambition&mdash;it's the prerequisite for it.

> Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

> <cite>&mdash; Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry</cite>

Consider how the best tools disappear into the work. A well-designed chair doesn't announce itself; it simply supports you. The same principle applies to how we structure our days, our projects, our thinking.

## Three Rules for Subtraction

1. **Remove before you add.** When something feels off, the instinct is to layer on a fix. Resist it. Ask what can be taken away first.
2. **Protect empty space.** An open afternoon isn't wasted time. It's where your best ideas will find you.
3. **Let things be small.** Not every project needs to scale. Not every idea needs a roadmap. Some of the best things stay exactly the size they started.

In code, the same philosophy applies. Here's a small function that embraces doing less:

<div class="code-block">
  <div class="code-header">
    <span class="code-lang">JavaScript</span>
    <button class="code-copy">Copy</button>
  </div>
  <pre><code>function simplify(tasks) {
  return tasks
    .filter(task =&gt; task.essential)
    .sort((a, b) =&gt; a.priority - b.priority)
    .slice(0, 3);
}
// Do less, but do it well.
const today = simplify(myTasks);</code></pre>
</div>

There's a Japanese concept called *ma*&mdash;the purposeful pause, the space between things that gives them meaning. A rest in music isn't silence; it's part of the composition. The gap between words on a page isn't emptiness; it's what makes reading possible.

Perhaps the real skill isn't doing more. It's learning what deserves your attention at all.
